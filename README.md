 <figure>
      <p>Go, Eagles, Go <span>(Go Where?)</span></p>
      <p>Put all you have in every play</p><span>(What if I don't have alot?)</span>
      <p>We’ll let you know</p><span>(When?)</span>
      <p>That we are with you all way</p>
    </figure><span>(You're smothering)</span>
    
    <figure>
      <p>So then it’s fight, Eagles, fight</p><span>(Scuffle!)</span>
      <p>Show us the fight we’d like to see</p><span>(or forced to see)</span>
      <p>Red and White just fight, fight, fight</p>
      <p>And Eagles will win the victory!</p>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <p>EASTERN!</p>
      <p>Eastern Eagles GO FIGHT WIN!</p>      
    </figure>
